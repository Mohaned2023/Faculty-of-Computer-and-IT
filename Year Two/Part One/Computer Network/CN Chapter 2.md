> When communication is simple, we may need only one simple protocol; when the communication is complex, we need a protocol at each layer, or protocol layering.

#### The OSI model:
- **Layer 7:** ==Application==
- **Layer 6:** ==Presentation==
- **Layer 5:** ==Session==
- **Layer 4:** ==Transport==
- **Layer 3:** ==Network==
- **Layer 2:** ==Data Link==
- **Layer 1:** ==Physical==
#### Layers in the TCP/IP protocol suite:
- **Layer 5:** ==Application==
- **Layer 4:** ==Transport==
- **Layer 3:** ==Internet==
- **Layer 2:** ==Network Interface==
-  **Layer 1:** ==Hardware Devices==

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The OSI model appeared after the TCP/IP protocol suite.

> [!NOTE]
> Most experts were at first excited and thought that the TCP/IP protocol would be fully replaced by the OSI model.
> This did not happen for several reasons, but we describe only three, which are agreed upon by all experts in the field.
#### Definitions:
1. **Multiplexing:** *means that a protocol at a layer can encapsulate a packet from several next-higher layer protocols (one at a time).*
2. **Demultiplexing:** *means that a protocol can decapsulate and deliver a packet to several next-higher layer protocols (one at a time).*
