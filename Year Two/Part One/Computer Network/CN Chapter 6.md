#### Classes of transmission media:
- **Guided (Wired):** *which are those that provide a conduit from one device to another*
	- Twisted-pair Cable.
	- Coaxial Cable.
	- Fiber-optic Cable.
- **Unguided (Wireless):** *Unguided media transport electromagnetic waves without using a physical conductor.*
	- Free Space.
#### Propagation modes:
- Multimode: 
	- Step index.
	- Graded index.
- Single Mode.
#### Propagation methods:
- **Ground Propagation:** below 2MHz
- **Sky Propagation:** 2-30MHz
- **Line-of-sigth Propagation:** above 30MHz
#### Wireless transmission waves:
- Radio Wave.
- Microwave.
- Infrared.

> [!NOTE]
> Radio waves are used for multicast communications, such as radio and television, and paging systems.

> [!NOTE]
> Microwaves are used for unicast communication such as cellular telephones, satellite networks, and wireless LANs.

> [!NOTE]
> Infrared signals can be used for short-range communication in a closed area using line-of-sight propagation.
