### Versioning Strategy:

We use **Semantic Versioning (SemVer)** with the format `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`:

- **MAJOR**: Incremented for significant changes such as the completion of an entire academic year (e.g., after adding new sections or major structural changes).
- **MINOR**: Updated when new subjects (theoretical or practical) are introduced in a specific section (e.g., at the end of the first or second semester).
- **PATCH**: Changed when new lectures are added to existing subjects, or small updates are made (e.g., new lectures for an existing course).

**Example:**
- `v1.0.0`: Initial release.
- `v1.1.0`: New subjects added in the first semester.
- `v1.1.1`: Additional lectures for existing subjects.
- `v2.0.0`: Major changes after completing the second year.
